# Lukas Michel Portfolio

Hello there!

My name is Lukas. I am a professional Software Engineer, mostly focused on Cloud-Native Applications in the
AWS ecosystem.

I got my Bachelor's Degree from HTW Berlin, which is a renowned "College" for it's very hands-on approach to teaching Computer Science.

I've worked for MHP for close to 3 years now. I started as a student, did my bachelor thesis with them and was then hired as a full-time Consultant!

There I was able to participate at a number of projects for different companies.

Here are notable Projects I've contributed to:

- Full-Stack Engineer on an Identity Provider for a large agriculture company
- multiple Cloud Transformation for one of the biggest OEMs in Germany
